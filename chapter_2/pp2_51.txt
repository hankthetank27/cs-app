We saw in Problem 2.46 that the Patriot missile software approximated 0.1 as x =
0.00011001100110011001100.

Suppose instead that they had used IEEE round-to-even mode to determine an approximation x to 0.1 with 23 bits to the right of
the binary point.

A. What is the binary representation of x?
    1/10 = 0.00011001100110011001101
    This answer was somewhat unintuitve to me at first, as its based on the assumption that 
    the binary representation of 1/10 is nonterminating, therefor it's implied that the following
    two digits are "11", rather than refering to the the 23 bit representation of 1/10 given.

B. What is the approximate decimal value of x âˆ’ 0.1?
    0?
