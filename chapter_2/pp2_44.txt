A. False, if x is tmin, then x - 1 will cause a negative overflow
B. True, if the left side evaluates to true x = 7 || x = 15, both of which have
    msb of 1 if x<<29

    (0111 & 0111) = 7
    (1111 & 0111) = 7
    1110 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000

C. False, can overflow
D. True, if x is not less than zero, then it is less than or equal to zero if inverted.
E. False if x = tmin.
F. True. Twoâ€™s-complement and unsigned addition have the same bit-level behavior,
    and they are commutative.
